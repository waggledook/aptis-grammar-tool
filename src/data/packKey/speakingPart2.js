For example, if you have a regular schedule, you don’t waste time deciding what to do next, and that can reduce stress. Personally, I like having a routine during the week because it helps me stay productive and maintain good habits, like exercising or going to bed at a reasonable time. However, I also think it’s important to be flexible, especially at the weekend, so life doesn’t become too repetitive or boring.",

Living alone can be great because you have complete privacy and independence, and you can organise your life exactly how you want. On the other hand, living with other people can be more enjoyable because you have company and someone to talk to, and it can also be cheaper since you share expenses. Personally, I think living with the right people is the best option, because you get the social benefits without feeling lonely, but it’s important that everyone respects each other’s space.",

                      "To my mind, making public transport free would be very positive, especially for the environment, because more people would choose buses or trains instead of using their cars. This could reduce traffic and pollution, particularly in large cities. It would also help people who have lower incomes, because transport costs can be quite expensive over time. However, public transport systems still need funding, so the money would have to come from somewhere, like taxes. Overall, I think it’s a good idea, but it would need careful planning to make sure it works properly.",

Reading helps improve vocabulary and language skills, and it also develops concentration and imagination. For example, when you read a book, you need to focus for a longer time, which is good for your brain. Personally, I try to read regularly, especially things that interest me, because I feel like I learn something new each time. I think reading will continue to be important, even if the format changes, like reading online instead of on paper.",

I usually go when there’s a special exhibition that interests me, or when friends or family are visiting and we want to do something cultural. For example, last year I visited an art museum with a friend and it was really interesting because I learned a lot about local artists. In general, I enjoy museums because they help you understand history and culture better, but sometimes I don’t go simply because of lack of time. If I had more free time, I’d definitely like to visit them more regularly."

                    answer:
                      "In my opinion, the way people meet has changed quite a lot in recent years, mainly because of technology. In the past, people mostly met through friends, work, or social events, but nowadays it’s very common to meet people online first using apps or social media. For example, many people now form friendships or relationships through platforms before meeting face-to-face. This can be convenient because it allows people to connect with others who have similar interests. However, I think it also means that people sometimes spend less time interacting in person, which can make relationships feel less natural. Overall, technology has made meeting people easier, but also different."

                    prompt: "What is the usual way people greet each other in your country?",
                    answer:
                      "In my country, the way people greet each other depends on the situation and how well they know each other. In formal situations, people usually say hello and shake hands, especially in professional environments. However, among friends and family, greetings are much more informal. For example, people often hug, and in some cases they greet each other with a kiss on the cheek. This is especially common in social situations. I think greetings are important because they show politeness and help create a friendly atmosphere. Compared to the past, greetings are becoming slightly more informal, especially among younger people."
