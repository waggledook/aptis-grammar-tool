                explanation:
                  "Main idea = a gradual change in behaviour: cash becoming less common; contactless feels ‘more normal’; cash as a ‘back-up’ rather than default."

                  "Inclusion issue: not everyone has banking/smartphones/internet; some rely on cash for budgeting or because they’re excluded from digital tools."

                explanation:
                  "Privacy: cash is anonymous; electronic payments create records and raise concerns about who controls/uses personal data."
