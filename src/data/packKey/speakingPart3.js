On the other hand, cities often have better services, like hospitals and more activities. So it depends, but if you want a relaxed lifestyle and more nature, the village is probably a good choice for families.",

                          "Yes, I think it’s quite possible because more jobs can be done remotely now. If people don’t need to commute every day, living outside the city becomes more attractive. Housing can be cheaper and the quality of life can be better. That said, cities still offer more opportunities, so not everyone will leave, but I think we’ll see more people moving outwards.",
